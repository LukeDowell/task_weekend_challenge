#Write up
Transitioning from Express to Hapi was very difficult. With the new release of Hapi 9.x, a lot of the existing documentation was incorrect and many of the resources that I was
able to find proved unhelpful. Serving a static page involved manually adding routes to handle sourcing requests from my html pages. I still don't think that I am
handling this problem correctly.


#Challenge
GAMMA!

You made it through week 5! One more weekend challenge!

TECHNOLOGY SWAP OUTS!

For this challenge, its all about working with an existing project and making technology changes. You will need to take the existing jQuery and replace it with Angular.
jQuery needs to be completed remove. Nuke all the existing files, the code, and even npm uninstall! Then, bring in Angular! Note that are a couple obvious things we have not covered in Class.
This was by design. One of the focuses here at the end of Tier 2 is to become dependent on documentation and research. We will not note what these points of research are, it is your responsibility
to examine the project and discover all the points that need to be replaced, research the Angular implementation of the previous jQuery functionality,  and ensure that the functionality remains intact.

Existing Project: https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/prime_peer_db_pg_01

HARD MODE
Now that you have replaced jQuery for Angular, now replace SQL with MongoDB! You will obviously need a new database, no need to worry about data migration from SQL to MongoDB.

PRO MODE
Replace Express.js with Hapi.js (WAIT! What the heck is Hapi!? Something new, you will obviously need to do some research!)
